# MotoButtons Lite
A low cost, waterproof, Bluetooth (BLE) controller for [Drivemode Dashboard](https://www.drivemodedashboard.com/) motorcycle navigation

## Why a DIY controller?
As of October of 2023, [all available controllers](https://www.drivemodedashboard.com/certified-remote-controllers/) for Drivemode Dashboard are rather expensive, especially if shipped outside of Europe, or do not offer the ideal functionality in a small size. The [least expensive controller](https://www.thorkracing.com/produto/arn-remote-pro/) that is in stock and can be shipped to the USA costs $215 USD with shipping. Since many riders have two, three or even four motorcycles, the total cost could be as high as $683, just for a set of basic controllers! However, even this controller only offers a two-way switch, so functionality is limited. 

On the other hand, an ideal controller would offer a low price, small size, light weight and a 5-way navigation switch (joystick). The joystick could be used either as a "mouse" (up/down/left/right/click) or to manipulate Drivemode Dashboard functions. 

## Cost and Parts Availability
As a DIY controller, the MotoButtons Lite has been designed with the highest quality, IP68 (waterproof) parts, while maintaining a low cost. In fact, the necessary parts can be ordered from Mouser.com for only $27.82 plus $7.99 UPS shipping. The only exception is that a low cost, IP68 rated 5-way navigation switch can not be purchased at this time. Thus, you will waterproof a $2.50 switch, which is surprisingly rugged and user friendly. In addition, you will need some epoxy glue, basic hole drilling tools and some other basic supplies, which most DIY enthusiasts will have in their garage.

## Recommended Tools and Supplies
To build your own Motobuttons Lite, I suggest the following tools and supplies, which can be obtained at Amazon and [Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/), for example. However, as a DIY enthusiast, you will hopefully already have many suitable tools.

- [C-POXY 30 by CECCORP](https://www.amazon.com/CECCORP-C-Poxy-30/dp/B0918TGK53)
  - Do not use a quick setting epoxy (e.g. 1 or 5 minute), as it lacks strength and sets too quickly for proper construction
- [Step drill with 35/64" diameter](https://www.harborfreight.com/2-piece-titanium-nitride-coated-high-speed-steel-step-drills-96275.html)
- [Wire size drill bit set for #56 and #60 drill bits](https://www.amazon.com/Drill-Speed-Steel-Numbered-Metal/dp/B07SW836NQ/ref=sr_1_9?crid=2E4TQN5R710MU)
  - Only needed if you don't already have #56 and #60 drill bits, such as in a 115 piece set
- [Automatic center punch](https://www.harborfreight.com/spring-loaded-center-punch-621.html)
