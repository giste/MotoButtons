## Pairing with your phone
When MotoButtons is first powered on, both button LEDs will flash rapidly until the device is paired with your phone. If pairing is ever lost during use, they will start flashing again.

To pair with your phone, power up MotoButtons and ask your phone to pair with the Bluetooth device named "DMD2 CTL 8K" by navigating to Bluetooth pairing in the phone's Settings. This name is chosen for compatibility with the Drivemode Dashboard beta app. Once paired with your phone, it should quickly auto-connect when powered on again. 

## Cycling Through Modes
MotoButtons supports multiple modes of operation, including:
1. Mouser cursor mode
2. Drivemode Dashboard 2 mode
3. MyRoute App mode

MotoButtons can be cycled through these modes, in that order (Mouse->DMD2->MRA) by holding down both A and B buttons for 1 second. When advancing the mode, both LEDs will flash rapidly for 2 seconds. Then LED A will flash to indicate the mode number (one flash for DMD2, two flashes for mouse, three flashes for MyRoute App). 

The mode state will be saved so that the last mode prior to power down will be activated at the next power up. In other words, if you keep your MotoButtons set to MyRoute App mode, it will remember that when you use it next.

## Button Mapping
This section describes the button mapping for each mode.

### Mouse Mode
Mouse mode is simple. The joystick moves the mouse cursor. Pressing the center of the joystick will simulate a left click. In addition, pressing Button B will also simuilate left click. Pressing Button A will simulate hitting the enter key on a keyboard. 

### Drivemode Dashboard 2 Mode
The joystick controls up/down/left/right, accordingly. A button activated F5, B button F6 and long pressing the joystick center activates F7.

### MyRoute App Mode
When in MyRoute App mode, the joystick will pan the map view. Buttons A and B will zoom the map view in and out. Long pressing the joystick center will activate the menu.
