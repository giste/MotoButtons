# User Guide
After finishing construction and uploading the software, apply power to your MotoButtons Lite. The buttons should start flashing whenever the device is not actively connected to your phone via Bluetooth. 

Pair the device to your phone by looking for "DMD2 CTL 7K" in Bluetooth Setttings on your phone. It will show up as a keyboard. 

You can switch the device between DMD2 mode and "mouse cursor" mode by holding down both A and B buttons for one second. In mouse mode, the navigation joystick will move the mouse cursor around. You can click by either depressing the joystick center or Button B. Hold down buttons A and B again to switch back to DMD2 mode.
